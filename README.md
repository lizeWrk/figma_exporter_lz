## Why ðŸ¤”

Using the Figma Exporter package is beneficial because, when the color naming conventions in the project differ from those in Figma, developers often spend a significant amount of time deciding on color names, checking whether a color already exists in the project, and verifying the corresponding variable name for the color code. This package streamlines the process by converting color tokens into classes and enums, saving time and reducing the manual effort required.

## How ðŸ¤–

- `figma_exporter_lz` looks for `token` in the `./scripts/colors` files located in the directory, and fetches all the tokens.
- Then it looks for all the `#hexCode` and `token naming`.
- after then will regenerate the into `enums` or `class`.
- finally you only need to follow the figma variable name and assigned the

## Limitations ðŸ˜”

- This package currently works only for `Figma`, which exported from Figma and located the token in `.scripts/color` file.
- It required use `local variable` in figma.
- mainly for `personal use`, therefore output and input file structure is hardcoded.

## Error and Limitation ðŸ˜­

- when you used `Previous` version before, you might notice new upgraded/commits is not working. please delete `pubspec.lock` then `pub get` to get the latest commits/upgraded version.
